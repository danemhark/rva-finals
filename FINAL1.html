      <div class="box2">
      <p>Back in 1990, Supertyphoon Ruping (Typhoon Mike by its international name) hit <br>
         Cebu. The destruction it had caused brought unimaginable havoc and paralyzed the <br>
          whole island that the people were only relying on unsafe deep well sources. This <br>
           resulted on an outbreak of water bound diseases like El Tor, Cholera, Diarrhea and <br>
            Hepatitis. <br>

      As the demand for safe bottled drinking water products arises, unfortunately, these <br>
       were not readily available in the market. There were only a handful local and few <br>
       expensive foreign bottled water brands. <br>
      PSWRI committed the next several month in coming up with a viable way to alleviate <br>
       the growing problem of unsafe drinking water. Necessity and charity drove the <br>
       company to seek the best knowledge and production process to produce the safest <br>
        yet affordable drinking water for the Cebuanos and eventually every Filipino.</div>
